## Prerequisites
What we assume you have:
1. A computer
2. Some basic python programming skills (loops, if statements, etc.)
3. An installation of Python 3 (Python 2 may work as well, but it's untested)

## Code setup
1. Press the big green "Clone or download" button and download the zip file
2. Extract the zip file on your computer
3. Open `neopixel_template.py`
4. Run the python script to send commands to the matrix

## Hardware setup
Your hardware should already be set up, but if it isn't:
1. The USB cable should be plugged into your computer and the micro-usb port of the chip
2. There should be a wire from the chip's `5V` pin to the matrix's `+5V` pin
3. There should be a wire from the chip's `G` pin to the matrix's `GND` pin
4. There should be a wire from the chip's `D4` pin to the matrix's `DIN` pin
